# PlayerManager
A very simple python app with a GUI that can help amateur group of friends to manage their levels for any sport, in order to make balanced teams of 5 or 8 people.

REQUIREMENTS:
You don't need anything more then python.

INSTRUCTION:
Download the code, launche the playermanager.py.
A GUI will appear. The first time that you use the app you'll need to register (using add player) a minimum of ten players.
After that, you'll be able to genereate teams of 5 or 8 people using "make teams".
After the match, remember to adjust the values by clicking on "adjust values" that will add 0.1 to the level of the winners (and reduce by 0.1 the level of the losers).
